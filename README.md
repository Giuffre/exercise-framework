#Exercise framework
Oilproject extensible exercise framework

##Description
OEEF is a modular framework to generate different kind of exercise. You can add new exercise model being independent from the backend.
The only dependence (for the core) will be (i hope) require.js.

###How it works
##Backend
Every exercise have to be saved in the same way, for example:
* id (single (1 => Math, 2 => Chem ,ecc..) or nested ('Math'=> (1=>'Calc', 2=> 'Graph', 3=>'Write the function'), 'Lett' =>(1=>'Multichoice', 2=>'Complete the phrase'), ecc...))
